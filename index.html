      <p>About our wonderful teacher</p>
      <p>Ms.Chen is one of the only computer science teacher at our school for AP Computer science principles and Ap Computer science advanced. These are incredible feats are astounding, because without Ms.Chen we would't have anything close to the computer science coverage that our school currently boasts. Not only does our teacher widen the ciriculum of our school but she does so with the upmost kindess and patience, almost every one of Ms.Chen's students can agree with how great of a teacher Ms.Chen is. Even with the most challenging of students Ms.Chen finds the best way to help a student succeed. </p>

      <p>Tragedy strikes</p>
      <p>Halfway through our second semester a terrible tragedy struck an undeserving person. One day in class Ms.Chen had pulled us aside for a important conversation with the class. Through the conversation Ms.Chen had divulged that she had Breast cancer and that for the rest of the semester we would have substitutes. But just because we had a sub didn't mean that Ms.Chen did any less work, our teacher did what none of us expected. Ms.Chen went out of her way while in treatment for cancer to keep up with all the grading for our class. Everyone in class was amazed and thankful to hear that Ms.Chen was still helping us succeed twords our AP Exam. </p>
